# Basic example

This is a very minimal HTML5 application built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io) builder
that uses [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org) web framework on top of Backbone MVC library.

## Getting started
* Install [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`.
* Install Brunch plugins: `npm install`
* Install Bower components: `bower install`
* Watch the project with continuous rebuild by
`brunch watch --server`. This will also launch HTTP server.
* Build the minified project with `brunch build --optimize`.
* Open the `public/` dir to see the result.
* Write your code in `app` dir, install dependencies with Bower.

See [Chaplin site](http://chaplinjs.org) for docs and more info.

## How it works
1. Route (URL) match.
2. Controller initialization.
3. Model and view initialization.

1. When you navigate to URL in Chaplin application,
Chaplin.Router instance tries to match URL against
all routes defined in `routes` property passed to
`Chaplin.Application` (see `app/initialize`).
2. If successful, Chaplin.Dispatcher loads corresponding controller.
If route specifies `users#show`, it will load `controllers/users-controller`.
3. Controller initializes models and views as instance properties.
Previous controller and its models / views are auto-cleaned-up.
